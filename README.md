2. Brief instructions on how to run your game (be sure to submit all necessary files so that the TAs can run and play your game on their computer).

  Click the small board that you want to start with. All the others will disappear. Once someone wins or there is a tie (see below), the big board will return and the color of the boxes will indicate who won. Once someone has three in a row, there will be a winner. The restart button will start the game over, even if you're on a small 3x3 board. The exit button closes the window. After a small game is won, there is an option to play another board, and once there is a final winner, there is an option to play another game. 
  
3. If your group chose to implement extra features in order to obtain some extra credit points, please describe that feature (or those features) in this file. 

  Ties: Ties are handled by awarding the win to the player with the least number of spots on the board. Basically, it awards the   win to the player who lost the previous game (since the winner starts first and therefore will always have more spots).

  Aesthetics (animation and GUIs): 
  Moving Buttons: The restart, exit, and play again buttons are animated.
  Xs and Os: Are special images of nature.
  To differentiate each board, we use different color backgrounds, and when someone has won a game, it is indictated by changing the background to the shape (either a blue O or a grey X).

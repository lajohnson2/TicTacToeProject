Pseudocode

create list of options for user to pick which board we need to use
--> perhaps by using the type-in interface

Once picked,
- highlight the large square that is being used for the game
- make sure that things outside this square cannot be changed
- have the people play the game
        - users can click on any UNUSED square to make Xs or Os
        - if 3 in a row, say that user won the game
- if three large games in a row, than that user wins the match
        - a game over screen should be shown, showing who won and if there was a tie
